An ssh-key is a passcode that allows access to a password-protected remote resource without needing you to type in your password. Due to security concerns around the one step password authentication, remote resources aimed at a programming audience have increasingly shifted to ssh-key authentication rather than password entry. When accessing cloud resources, private git repositories, and various other resources setting up an ssh-key might be necessary.

Generating ssh-keys:
ssh-keys come in public/private pairs generated by a specified cryptography algorithm, frequently rsa (no need to understand the internals of this, the default is usually sufficient). On most standard mac, linux, and even windows computers the terminal/powershell should have a command called ssh-keygen. This will automatically create a public and private key stored in your ~/.ssh/ [[hidden_folder]]. The command comes with a number of additional commands that allow you to change the algorithm used, the size of the key, the file path (if you don't want it in ~/.ssh/), and several other parameters. After running the command you'll be asked what name you want to give it and if you'd like to set a passcode. Both inputs are arbitrary as long as you can remember but it's generally better to pick something that won't be confused with possible future keys and safely store the information somewhere you can find. The windows process is a 

After generation of the key you should see two new files in your ~/.ssh folder. If no file name is specified it will default to id_rsa and id.rsa.pub . The first file contains your private key and the second contains your public key. On github and gitlab settings there should be a tab called something like "ssh keys". It will ask for your ssh public key which you can obtain by either running "cat ~/.ssh/file_name.pub" and pasting the contents or opening the file.pub with any plain text editor and copy pasting the contents. 

To be fully transparent I have had difficulty properly configuring and managing multiple keys to different resources on a single computer. Whenever I need to add an ssh key I usually end up in a long chain of tutorials on how to get the application to look at the right key and ignore all the others. I recall that being a solvable but frustrating process. Unfortunately I never got to the point of being confident on it so instead of giving shaky advice I'd advise searching for relevant tutorials.
