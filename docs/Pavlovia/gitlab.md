Gitlab is an online repository hosting website that enables remote storage and access to a codebase with git version control. The user experience is very similar to github with additional configuration options for managing deployment and "devops" work. Pavlovia uses gitlab to manage the hosting of experiments so our primary lab use for this resource is currently just for Pavlovia experiment management. This page allows you to sign into your Pavlovia gitlab account: https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/users/sign_in

It is advised to set up an [[ssh_key]] to connect your local or server-located repository to the gitlab remote repository. After setting this up [[git_commands]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[ssh_key]: ssh_key "ssh_key"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
