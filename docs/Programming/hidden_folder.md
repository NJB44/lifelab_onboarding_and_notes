In most operating systems there are both files/folders that are publicly visible and those that are hidden to remove 'clutter' or reduce chances of deleting important things. Most of these files/folders are preceded with a '.' as in '.ssh', '.vimrc', '.ipython', '.afnirc'. Graphical "finder" applications will typically hide these files from you unless you find and change a setting. In the terminal a default [[ls]] command will not show hidden files unless you add an 'all/-a flag' (ls -a )
