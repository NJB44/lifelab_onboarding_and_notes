An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a program designed for plain text editing of programming scripts and related files. There's a large number of available IDEs and many are language specific. The space is as varied as messenger apps with a lot of opinionated takes. 

It's best to use whatever you're comfortable with but my personal recommendations are:
    - Visual-studio code (vscode): for html, javascript, python, and general use
    - Rstudio: for anything R related
    - [[jupyter_notebooks]] : for example analysis scripts
    - spyder: if you're doing data analysis in python, want something closer to rstudio for it, and neither jupyter nor fits your use case

Some other more esoteric things I personally use are:
    - [[vim]]: for server file editing and as key bindings inside all IDES
        - Note: vim is purely for convenience and preference. Remote file edits can also be done with [[nano]] and any IDE works just as well with normal key bindings.
    - [[emacs]]: this one is a notorious rabbit hole of configurations and frustrations. There is interestingly a lot of support for scientific writing workflows in this that I've wanted to set up for a while but haven't yet. Spacemacs and Doom emacs are interesting recent projects that bring a lot of functionality to emacs. Spacemacs bindings also exist in vscode and can help speed up editing.
