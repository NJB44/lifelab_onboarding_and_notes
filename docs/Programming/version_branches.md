Git allows you to create branching versions of the code, which can be useful for things like: trying out different coding strategies and quickly switching between them, maintaining slight variations for different uses, and keeping "updates in progress" separate from the current best/working version.

Commands:
- git branch {name}
   - Allows creation of a new branch 
   - the -d flag will delete the named branch
- git checkout {name}
    - Switches your local codebase and current branch to another already existing branch
