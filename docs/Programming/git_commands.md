Git is a version control software that allows for well organized code editing with [[version_branches]] and access to all previous versions. 

Git can be used from the command line, from a user interface (with some limitations), or from an [[ide]]. Regardless of what medium you use it from there are several commands that are central to the workflow:
    - git clone {url}
      - This will download a repository from a github page into your current working directory and connect you to the remote repository in a way that allows more convenient updating
    - git pull 
        - After setting up a remote repository connection git pull will automatically update the versions of your files to match the remote version. 
          - If multiple people are working on the same repository this may create [[merge_conflicts]].
    - git add {file_1 file_2}
        - This will [[stage]] the files added. If you want to stage everything git add * can be used instead. 
        - multiple files can be added with a space separated list
    - git commit -m {commit message}
        - After you've staged new or edited files git commit will save a "snapshot" of the repository as it currently is right now
        - If you haven't yet staged your edits you can add the -a flag to stage all new files for commit
        - a message is required for every committed version. this can either be set with the -m flag followed by a string or if it is omitted git will give you the option to write one in nano, vim, or some ide-based file editing interface
    - git push 
      - If you've made local edits to a repository, 

These commands only scratch the surface of git's options but should cover the most frequently used instances.
