The basal ganglia are a collection of subcortical regions that are responsible for the production of complex motivated behavior. The circuits drive much of human motor behavior and are also heavily involved in theories about [[reinforcement_learning]] in people

The structures include: 
- [[substantia_nigra]]
- caudate 
- putamen 
- globus pallidus
- parts of [[thalamus]]
