Phylo-/phylum refers roughly to a class or category and as the term was coined in 1866 -genetic refers to the "genesis" rather than "genetic dna code" that we now associate with the word. 

It is frequently talked about in regard to structures and features that are shared with our genetic ancestors and calling something phylogenetically "older" refers to how far back the thing was conserved in evolution. In the brain structures closer to the spinal cord tend to be phylogenetically older and shared with more distant relatives like reptiles whereas structures farther from the spine (like the cortex) tend to be phylogenetically newer and only shared with mammals or primates.
