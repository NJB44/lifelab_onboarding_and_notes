A natural but somewhat naive question about neuroscience is "how many brain areas are there?" While the question is well motivated there is unfortunately no definitive way to answer it for the same reason one cannot answer "how many words are there?", "how many places are there?", or "how many ideas are there?" The fundamental problem with this approach is that what it means to "be a brain area" is overloaded at best and ill posed at worst. 

Similar to how a country might have differing boundaries for states, cities, tax counties, congressional districts, etc. research into the brain will divy up the brain matter into differing ways depending on the application and purpose. Any given system of splitting the brain up is referred to as an [[atlas]]. Atlases can range from having about 10 regions to the hundreds or thousands.

For some broad generally reliable divisions of the brain these categories and terminologies are useful to recognize:
- [[skull_and_meninges]] 
- [[gray_matter]]
- [[white_matter]]
- [[cortex]]
- [[basal_ganglia]]
- [[subcortex]]
- [[brainstem]]
- [[cerebrum]]
- [[cerebellum]]
- [[lobes]]
- [[gyri]]
- [[sulci]]
