The pituitary gland is the only part of the brain that simultaneously interfaces with neurons and the hormonal system. The anterior portion is neural-tissue and the posterior portion is hormonal/gland-like. It can be thought of as a sort of conductor for the hormonal system, releasing mediator chemicals that launch larger hormonal responses farther downstream.

In stress research its role in the [[HPA_axis]] is what directly mediates the release of adrenaline and cortisol stress-responses from the [[adrenal_gland.md]].
