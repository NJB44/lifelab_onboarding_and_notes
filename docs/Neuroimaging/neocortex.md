The neocortex comes from "new-cortex" and describes the evolutionarily newer regions that are more characteristic of mammals and primates with greater similarity to humans (generally new/old in evolutionary terms is roughly synonymous with "degree of similarity to humans"). 

The term is usually used to draw attention to regions more characteristic of higher-order cognition (as opposed to meso-cortical or non-cortical regions) but anatomically I've never been sure if there are precise borders to what counts as "neo-cortex" as opposed to "non-neo" cortex.
