Cortex/cortices (sing./plural) comes from the latin for "bark" or "outer husk". Fittingly it describes the outer most part of the brain. The classic 4 lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital) is all considered cortex, and only the more inner and lower regions are non-cortical (e.g. subcortex, midbrain, cerebellum, brainstem). 

A few more specific terminology with 'cortex' include:
 - [[neocortex]]
 - [[prefrontal-cortex]]
