The skull is a very familiar structure but the meninges are perhaps less so. The area between where the skull ends and where the brain begins is where the meninges reside. There are three layers to this structure, referred to for some reason as "maters/mothers". In order these are the: 1. dura (hard) mother, 2 arachno (spider) mother, and 3. pia (soft) mother.

A common step of brain scan pre-processing is to "skull strip". This would ideally remove both the skull and the meninges but as the grayscale values of brain and meninges are relatively close it is challenging to accurately make a brain-meninges boundary that doesn't run the risk of mistaking brain for meninges and removing data. Because of this you frequently end up with meninges left in the image after skull-stripping and some software (like [[freesurfer]]) accidentally mistake meninges for the gray matter next to it and give false/inflated measures of the brain.
