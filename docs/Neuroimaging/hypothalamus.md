The hypothalamus, as the name implies, is located directly underneath the [[thalamus]] (hypo-/under with respect to the thalamus). It contains a large number of sub [[nuclei]] each with their own functions but a common theme through many of these functions is a relevance to core physiological needs that keep homeostasis like temperature-control, hunger, and thirst.

The hypothalamus is the first structure of the [[HPA_axis]] system and is thought of as "initiating" the stress response. Though there are usually more inputs to the hypothalamus farther upstream chronologically these are diffuse across the brain, context dependent, and hard to definitively characterize in a way that keeps the generality of the HPA-axis stress response.
