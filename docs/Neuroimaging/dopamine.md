A fairly famous neurotransmitter. While this chemical is often hyped as being the "pleasure molecule" and the thing that makes people happy, the truth is more complex. It is very important in learning through reinforcement, in production of motivated behavior, in addiction and in assessing prediction errors (of relevance to [[reinforcement_learning]] models). 

This chemical plays a key role in the operation of the [[basal_ganglia]] circuits.
