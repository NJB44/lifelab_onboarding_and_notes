Affective neuroscience roughly refers to the study of emotions, mood, and the related disorders. Study into depression, bipolar, and other such mood disorders often falls under the "affective neuroscience" umbrella. As we study stress and its effects on the nervous system also impact the affective systems this research has a decent amount of overlap with our lab's interests.
