Fundamentally an MRI is a method of producing images based on electro-chemical properties of a substance. In our case we are producing volumetric images of the brain in some form.

By changing parameters in how the MRI scan is acquired you're able to use the same physical machine to produce different "modalities". For our purposes there are three primary MRI modalities of interest:
- [[structural_mri]] (smri)
- [[functional_mri]] (dmri)
- [[diffusion_mri]] (dmri)
