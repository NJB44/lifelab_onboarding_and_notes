A scan sequence describes the series of steps the MRI scanner needs to take in order to acquire the image. This usually takes the form of setting a number of parameters as input to the scan. Most scans use the same short sequence for each [[slice]] of the brain so the acquisition sequence gets repeated as many times as there are slices (like a for loop over each slice).
